# Tutoring Schedule
4 Days a week for 50 mins, I go through material that Khan Academy or Readtheory would do, and mom has to spend time on her own doing them.
Give homework for each subject due the next lecture

Use the whiteboard cuz you like using a whitebboard

Saturday - Science

Sunday - Math. +20 extra minutes of typing practice

Wednesday - RLA (Split between reading a book and ReadTheory)

Friday - RLA (Likely with read theory)


# Week 4
## Wednesday. RLA,

having mom read the princess book, going through every word she doesn't know and knowing she knows how to sound it out. Do for 25 minutes, and then the last half of class is read theory



# Week 3
## Friday: RLA
First 25 minutes is guided reading, discussion, learning new words, etc from the book. And then another 25 minutes on ReadTheory.

## Wednesday: Social Studies 

Review hw at the start of class

Continue with more crash course videos, only 2 this time to spend time together writing.

Crash Course Federalism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0gosGXSgsI&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H&index=4
Constitutional compromises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCCmuftyj8A&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H&index=5

# Week 2
## Wednesday: Social Studies

Watching videos, emphasize what's going to be on the actual GED and create homework for her to go back to the videos (do the first 2 together.)

Explicitly go over the restate the question, and then answer it for answering questions.

Episodes 1 through 3 of Crash Course history

## Friday: RLA

Spending 50 minutes simply on readtheory. Print out an assignment that simply says to do 2 Readtheory quizzes.

## Saturday: Science

Go through the Khan Academy videos, verbal quiz on each keypoints page

### During Class
Khan Academy: Middle School Biology
Unit 1: "Cells and Organisms", "Cell parts and functions"

Any extra time is spent on typing practice.

### Homework
Khan Academy: Middle School Biology
Unit 1: "Organization in the human body", "Sensory processing and the brain". Make sure to finish the Unit 1 test, we'll go over it in class next time

## Sunday: Math
Going to teach 2 digit addition

Start with one digit addition using hands:
2 + 7 = 9, 2 + 1 = 3, 4 + 4 = 8, 5 + 2 = 7, 1 + 4 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8, 1 + 8 = 9, 7 + 1 = 8, 2 + 1 = 3, 5 + 1 = 6,

Then do two digit addition with carrying:
35 + 76 = 111, 60 + 70 = 130, 29 + 1 = 30, 55 + 55 = 110, 84 + 49 = 133, 51 + 35 = 86, 87 + 61 = 148, 10 + 19 = 29, 83 + 31 = 114, 14 + 30 = 44,
