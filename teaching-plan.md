# Tutoring Schedule
4 Days a week for 50 mins, I go through material that Khan Academy or Readtheory would do, and mom has to spend time on her own doing them.
Give homework for each subject due the next lecture

Use the whiteboard cuz you like using a whitebboard

Saturday - Science

Sunday - Math. +20 extra minutes of typing practice

Wednesday - Social Studies (Guided reading of non-fiction texts and watching videos related to social studies)

Friday - RLA (Likely with read theory)

# Week 2
# Wednesday

Watching videos, emphasize what's going to be on the actual GED and create homework for her to go back to the videos (do the first 2 together.)

Explicitly go over the restate the question, and then answer it for answering questions.
