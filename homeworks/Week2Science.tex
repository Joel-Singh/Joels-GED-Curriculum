\maketitle

On Khan Academy, go to "Middle School Biology", and finish the last two sections of Unit 1 "Organization in the human body" and "Sensory processing and the brain". Make sure to complete the Unit 1 test, we'll go over it the next class. If you get stuck in understanding something,  that's okay, just stop and we can start where you got stuck from next class.
